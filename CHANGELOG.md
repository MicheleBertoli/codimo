- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`: update generator firm to match `lineGenerator`.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`: update generator firm.
  - 🚀 New parametter: `numbers`. Map of [position, number].
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: add `staticNumberGenerator` for non animated numbers.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`: update `receiveNumberAtPosition`. Now follows the promised animations rule.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: update `updatePosition`.
  - NOW: returns a `Promise<void>`. When the animation completes, resolves the promise.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/mazeGenerator`: update `MazeData.json` structure. Now it also contains the exit positions.
- [2017-04-19] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`:
  - 🐛 Fix how are defined each number square. This allow to add a number easly without the need to calculate any coordinate. Is the original expected behavior.
  - 🚀 Change firm. Instead of returning a `Container`, it follows the actual standard and returns an object that contains a `view` and another public properties.
  - 🚀 Add one property:
    - `receiveNumberAtPosition`: a function to add a `number` into an square at an specific `position`.
- [2017-04-19] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`:
  - 🐛 Fix how children are setted.
  - 🚀 Change firm. Instead of returning a `Container`, it follows the actual standard and returns an object that contains a `view` and another public properties.
  - 🚀 Add two properties:
    - `line`: it contains the visible numbers.

- 🚀 [2017-04-02] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`: add first version.
- 🚀 [2017-04-02] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: add GSAP TweenLite for movement animation.
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `test/PixiWrapper`: extract it from `engine/components/mazeGenerator.stories`. It's a little more generical!
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `engine/components/Block -> blockGenerator`: now it has one curry function to receive the representation color and then returns the blockGenerator specifically for that color. In the near future it will receive a texture instead of a color.
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `engine/components/Maze -> mazeGenerator`: extract the implementation that was done in the story. Then refactore it for the new blockGenerator implementation.
- 🚀 [2017-03-31] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: finish the first version of the game's actor object.
- 🚀 [2017-03-31] `flow-typed/pixi_v4.x.x`: finish the first version of the PixiJS' type definition.
- [2017-03-28] `engine/components/{Block|Maze}`: first version of unit elements of a Maze. Add one story for unit development. PixiJS ❤ ReactStoryBook.
- [2017-03-27] `engine/helpers/assetLoader`: create first version. It has a decent type definition.
- [2017-02-14] Add authorship to every file.
