# CÓDIMO

It's an acronym formed by the words **CODe**, **IMagination** and **MOtivation**, and it represents the design concept for this platform. We want CÓDIMO to be able to motivate students to do some of their common activities using a little extra of imagination.

But instead of coding and learning a particular programming language, we want to improve the Computational Thinking skills of each student by presenting challenges where they will need to resolve known activities in a new and entertaining way.
